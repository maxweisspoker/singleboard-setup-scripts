order of operations for odroid alarm:

packages removed:  linux-odroid-c2  uboot-odroid-c2

then present:  linux-aarch64 uboot-odroid-c2-mainline uboot-tools
but use shell and run --needed and with yes

also ignore errors because mkinitcpio hook may bork but still be successful
specifically this line:
    cp: cannot stat '(builtin)': No such file or directory
can safely be ignored. If that's the only failed, the build succeeded.
Arch Linux upstream is aware of the issue causing that, and it will be fixed in the future.


then (taken from arch uboot install script)

  if mountpoint -d /boot > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    base=/boot
  else
    base=/
  fi
  major=$(mountpoint -d $base | cut -f 1 -d ':')
  minor=$(expr $(mountpoint -d $base | cut -f 2 -d ':') - 1)
  device=$(cat /proc/partitions | awk {'if ($1 == "'${major}'" && $2 == "'${minor}'") print $4 '})
  cd /boot; ./sd_fusing.sh /dev/${device}

then mkinitcpio -p linux-aarch64   just for fun, ignore error

then reboot

then change boot.txt (and fail loudly if boot.txt doesn't exist) line

then run mkscr

then reboot

then install docker






odroid-c2:  pacman -S linux-aarch64 (force, includes other package removal; will encouter mkinitcpio warning that produces non-zero exit which is safe to ignore); pacman -R uboot-odroid-c2; pacman -S uboot-odroid-c2-mainline (will ask if you want to run uboot regeneration, you selected yes, but find out how to autoselect no and do it manually for ansible)

also install "uboot-tools" package

then reboot. you should be running newest linux kernel now

next you modify the newly created /boot/boot.txt file, and there should be a line:

setenv bootargs "console=ttyAML0,115200n8 root=PARTUUID=${uuid} rw rootwait earlycon"

and the quotes is where the kernel parameters go. so modify that line, inside the quotes, to add any parameters you want.

when finished, while in the dir /boot/, run the program /boot/mkscr (with sudo and no arguments). that will make a boot.scr binary file, which will include your boot.txt args, and will be loaded automagically on reboot.
