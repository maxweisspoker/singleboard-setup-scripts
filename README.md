### Single-board quick install scripts

These are personal bash/ansible scripts, as well as just some notes, which I am using as part of several projects I am working on. They are not remotely professional or safe to use -- they are just for my personal use. I am making them available just in case anybody finds them useful. They will require inspection and modification if you want to retrofit them for your own use. Use them at your own risk.

These scripts allow me to automate the headless installation of Arch Linux ARM on my Pi's and other single-board devices, as well as secure them and install Docker and K8s. (Yes damn it I am going to get K8s on Pi Zero nodes. I think I can do it and still have 100+ megs of ram to work with. It depends on how bloated the kube-proxy and service mesh daemon set applications are. But it's happening. Because it can.)
